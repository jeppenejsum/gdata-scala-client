   * A pickler for Person. The 'elem' and 'attr' methods define the XML structure.
   * The library handles already the '~' type (@see ~), but does not know about our Person
   * class. We use 'wrap' to provide a deconstructor and constructor of Person to/from the 
   * ~ objects. The same '~' is used as an operator for constructing sequences, denoting that
   * the 'name' element should be followed by an 'address' element. The basic 'text' pickler
   * handles plain text nodes. Hopefully, the new release of Scala (2.7.0) will improve 
   * the inferencer and make some code below not necessary.
